This project is my first attempt at training a classification machine learning model from scikit learn! In previous projects, I used k-nearest neighbors for classification in RStudio (written in R), so I wanted to attempt something similar using python instead. I used a tutorial from datacamp.com for reference on training a logistic regression model for classification, so please pardon any mistakes!
